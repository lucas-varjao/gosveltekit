Please generate comprehensive unit tests for the code below. The code is written in Go, and I need thorough unit tests that:

1. Cover all public methods/functions
2. Include test cases for happy paths and error scenarios
3. Test edge cases and boundary values
4. Follow Go testing best practices
5. Use the Go standard library whenever possible, avoiding third-party testing packages unless absolutely necessary
